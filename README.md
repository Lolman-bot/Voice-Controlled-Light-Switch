# Voice-Controlled-Light-Switch

This is my first major aduino project that i have created! It is designed to be stuck on a Australian style light switch wall socket with command strips, where actuators flick the switches mounted on the wall on and off.Voicecommands are customizable within the module and the code. The case has been 3d printed and mounted with a custom designed PCB (in files). All product parts are included in the CAD drawings except for the SEN0539 voice moudule and Arduino Nano Ble Rev 2.
